This is a React-Express project under development, so there are many random comments and the code is not organized yet.

It uses Express and Node.js to create the backend and simulate a database, but it's not optimized because 
the goal is to show some specific skills only, not launch a real project. The images, for instance,
can be sent as needed(through Intersection Observer) depending on the project needs in the future.

Besides, with React I incorporated the image section from my "Imagify" project.

If you want to test this project, open the React-Express directory and run the command
"npm run start" from the terminal. It will use Concurrently to start the Nodemon server and the React app.
