# Briefing

This is a __React-Express__ project _under development_, so there are many random comments and the code is not organized yet.

It uses __Express__ and __Node.js__ to create the __backend__ and simulate a __database__, but it's not optimized because 
the goal is to show some specific skills only, not launch a real project. The images, for instance,
can be sent as needed(through Intersection Observer) depending on the project needs in the future.

Besides, within the images section I incorporated the image section from my __Imagify__ project, adapting some aspects of it.

If you want to test this project, _open the React-Express directory and run the command
"npm run start" from the terminal_. It will use __Concurrently__ to start the __Nodemon server__ and the React app.
